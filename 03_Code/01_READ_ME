To Project Specifically - https://ejallen471.github.io/c111project/

The aim of this project is to find the best model to classify emails as spam or not spam. We look at the following models:

    1. logistic regression
    2. decision trees
    3. K-Nearest Neighbours
    4. Support Vector Machines
    5. Multi-Layer Perceptron classifer (MLP) - neural network
        5a. Sklearn Implmentation
        5b. PyTorch Implementation

The project is composed of several files:

02 - Data Visualisation: 
    - Intial processing and visualisation of the data
    - Data was sourced from - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase
    - Data is saved locally at 02_Data/spambase.data
    - For more information about the data, see 02_Data/spambase.DOCUMENTATION

03, 04, 05, 06, 07a:
    - These are individual files for each model, done using sklearn 
    - In each file there is an overview to how the algorithm works and each metric used to determine how accurate the model is - this has been done for my future reference in using and understanding the algorithms.
    - metrics used - Learning curve, ROC curve, AUC, MCC and Cohens Kappa

07b - Neural Network - pytorch:
    - implementation is different to 07a (and discussed in report)

07c - Neural Network - Manual:
    - Done for fun, not included within the report (not fully working either)

08 - ROC Curves:
    - Models from 03 to 07b to output a single graph of all roc curves
